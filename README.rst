vatic: open source risk analysis
==================================

Introduction
============

vatic software is a predictive-modeling, simulation, and analysis spreadsheet
application. It is designed to be a **viable open-source alternative** to 
commercial packages like `Crystal Ball`_, `@Risk`_ and `ModelRisk`_. It relies
on powerful Monte Carlo simulation and statistical analysis methods to reduce
the risk of uncertainty. Using the popular Python_ programming language, even
more control can be gained by utilizing the Vatic API directly, which means
that you can utilize other popular packages like NumPy_, SciPy_, and 
Matplotlib_ to further enhance the computing capabilities of vatic!

What can it be used on?
=======================

To be honest, virtually anything that you can model using the popular 
Microsoft Excel. Need to predict the likelihood that a business venture will
be successful? Want to know how many assemblies will be scrapped? What are 
the chances you'll finish your project on time and within budget? These are 
the kinds of questions that can be answered because vatic takes the guesswork
out of decisions where you don't know precisely what will happen. 

Who can use it?
===============

Again, virtually anyone who has access to Microsoft Excel and can construct
sufficient numerical models. You don't need to have advanced knowledge of
statistics because that all happens in the background.

What does "vatic" mean?
=======================

The word *vatic* is a Latin-English contraction of *vates* and *-ic* that
appears to have been first created in the early 17th century. Generally, 
it means "describing or predicting what will happen in the future".
